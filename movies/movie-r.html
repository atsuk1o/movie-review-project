            <p>Well, I finally got around to seeing this movie, arguably one of the most iconic and definitive films of the 21st century, and one of the most significant films I had never seen. Part of the reason I procrastinated so long with it (years) was because I thought it would be one of those movies that is so sophisticated a normal person can’t understand it. Usually with complex movies like these I actually follow along pretty well until about the hour-fifteen minute mark, at which point I cease to understand anything that’s happening (examples include <em>Minority Report</em>, <em>The Fugitive</em>, and <em>Flightplan</em>). To my surprise I ended up following along pretty well and enjoying the movie much more than I anticipated I would. I’ve had a slight grudge against anything Christopher Nolan-related since I saw <em>The Dark Knight</em> for the first time several months ago, which underwhelmed me completely. Part of the reason I didn’t enjoy that film as much was because I had a headache the entire time while watching it, but still. Anyways, I had had <em>Inception</em> on DVD for quite a while and I decided that it was due time to see it. And I’m glad I did; it is very well-made and actually I think most people will find something to enjoy about it. I’m not gonna act like this is some unknown movie that I’m the first one to discover, but I will say that it is quite good.</p>
		
            <p>The plot follows Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio), a skilled “extractor” who goes into people’s subconscious to find information in dreams. Cobb and his fellow extractor Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) are tasked by a businessman named Saito (Ken Watanabe) to perform “inception” inside the subconscious of Robert Fischer (Cillian Murphy), the son of one of Saito’s rival businessmen. Inception means putting an idea into a mind, instead of taking one out, which is a lot more difficult. In this case, Saito wants Cobb and Arthur to put the idea of destroying his father’s business into Fischer’s head. To do this, Cobb must assemble a team of other people who can pull this off, including Eames (Tom Hardy), a conman, Ariadne (Elliot Page), who will design the dream worlds, and Yusuf (Dileep Rao), a scientist who is basically their getaway driver. As the team starts to execute their mission Cobb has trouble because of his dead wife Mal (Marion Cotillard) constantly entering the dreams. That’s the basic idea; there is a LOT of other complicated stuff that could be considered spoilers that I also won’t get into here.</p>

            <p>I definitely enjoyed at least 80% of this movie. In terms of originality of concepts and creativity, <em>Inception</em> has a lot to offer. In fact, I’d even go as far as to say that it centers around one of the most original movie ideas of the 2010’s. The special effects and visual art are very well-done. It’s kind of a shame I didn’t get to see it in theaters, but I would’ve only been five years old at the time and I was busy watching more ~appropriate~ movies. Christopher Nolan did a great job directing this—you can tell it took forever to make. There were multiple scenes where I thought, “this must have cost a lot of money.” Visually, it is extremely impressive. The performances are decent and decent only, which is fine because this kind of movie doesn’t require much advanced acting, although I would say DiCaprio did an especially nice job. It’s also important how smoothly <em>Inception</em> blends science fiction with action, thriller, and drama. If you aren’t usually a fan of sci-fi, chances are you won’t mind this film. Despite this, <em>Inception</em> still more than satisfies a sci-fi fan’s needs for the bending of time and space. I will now praise the movie’s ambiguous and memorable ending: Cobb spins a top to test reality vs. dream, walks away, and we’re left unsure if it will fall. That’s now one of my favorite endings.</p>

            <p>I have a few small complaints, but they aren’t dealbreakers. My biggest problem is how the early sound effects are almost ridiculously loud while dialogue can be quiet. Turn it up to hear speech and then—boom—big crash. Another complaint (not the film’s fault) is I dislike widescreen’s black bars. Lastly, it can be tricky at times to know if we’re in a dream; perhaps that’s deliberate.</p>

            <h3>Safety Chart</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Violence:</strong> 7/10 — Shootings, explosions, car crashes. Not much blood. A man dies in a hospital bed (non-violent).</li>
              <li><strong>Language:</strong> 5/10 — Mostly minor; some profanities noted.</li>
              <li><strong>Drinking/Smoking:</strong> 3/10 — Some drinking; not notable.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="mb-0">In the end, I’m glad I can cross <em>Inception</em> off the long watchlist. If you like action movies or longer, intelligent thrillers, this one’s worth it.</p>
